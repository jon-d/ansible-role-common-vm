ansible-role-common-vm
=====================

This ansible role configure a debian vm to run in a ganeti environment.

Two modifications are made :

  - put the default waiting time of grub to on second (which should put the
    time to reboot most VM below 10 seconds)
  - setup a serial console with the right parameters, to allow access to the
    VMs with the ``gnt-instance console`` command.
